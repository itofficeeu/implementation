# Stability and Control

## DC bus signaling / droop control

Influencing factors for a stable system:

* Droop curves / thresholds for different components
* Wire length and thickness
* Maximum current

How to reconnect a load after an overcurrent event?

Suggestions:
* Through intelligent communication and negotiation between the things using the energy (the drain) and the source of the energy?
* By priority? - Drains with small consumption have higher priority? - So that light with higher priority comes before heavy equipment.
* The source offers/bids free energy capacity by some sort of communication channel. The first drain that requests this free energy, partly or in whole, gets his share. Others follow according to some rules until the free portion of energy is reserved and in used. Drains that don't pick up their request will lose their share og the available energy. ?
